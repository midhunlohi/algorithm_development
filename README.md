In this section, I am trying to implement different algorithms in C or C++ languages.

# Contents
1. Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm

2. Kadane's algorith to find maximum sum of a subarray.

3. Binary search algorithm to find the position of an element in a sorted array.

4. Reversal of singly linked list using recursion.
