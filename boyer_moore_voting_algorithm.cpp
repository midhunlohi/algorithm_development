/*
* Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm
* This algorithm is used for finding the majority of a sequence of elements
* using linear time and constant space.
* Majority element is the one which occurs repeatedly for more than half
* of the elements of the input.
* Please refer https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm
